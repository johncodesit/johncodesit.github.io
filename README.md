# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This small project was build using SWAPI API (https://swapi.dev/documentation).
It is responsive for mobile and tablet screens.
It's just a small quick implementation to test the public API.

Find more comments in the code itself.

Regards,
John
